## What is Guides ?
- Guides are step by step, in depth tutorials and blogs on machine learning topics.
- They aim to help people who are new, intermediate or even experts.
- Completely open-source free, written by community and maintained by community.

## Made With ML Guides is open for community collaborations :tada:

### What are we looking for? :eyes:

We are looking for **interesting colab notebooks(Jupyter notebooks) or scripts covering:** 

- In depth guides to ML/DL techniques ranging from beginner to advance level. An [example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rXV31gdyqEiXCtmSgff-H-VRuOSzv7IH?usp=sharing).
- Innovative approaches to common Machine learning Problems. An [example](https://github.com/ayulockin/DataAugmentationTF).
- Model benchmarking on lesser known datasets. 

We are not looking for ML/DL tasks which are commonly known and applied on widely known datasets. An example would be image classification on MNIST/Cifar-10 dataset.

However, we would appreciate image classification on lesser known (interesting) dataset.

### How can you contribute? :relaxed:

If you are working on an exciting ML/DL project, we would love to feature your work in this repo. The rules are simple:

1. Create a new issue with a relevant title. Briefly describe the project you are working on in a meaningful manner. Provide links wherever necessary.
2. We will review the issue and approve the idea if it meets the criteria we are looking for. 
3. Fork this repo.
4. Create a PR with notebook(s)/script(s).

We will have some starter [issues](https://github.com/madewithml/guides/issues) for you.
